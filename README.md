# Alexnet_on_CIFAR10
To read the first published research paper on ALEXNET click [here](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks.pdf)

AlexNet is the architecture that got everybodys attention after ages.In the year 2012 it was the winner of then IMAGENET competition with 15.3% error rate for top five predictions.

AlexNet introduced the concepts of MaxPooling and DropOut and made ReLU activation function more popular.It also said that training of many layers is possible on the GPUs.
> **The AlexNet is not pretrained and the last layer output nodes are kept to 10 to make it suitable for 10 classifications in CIFAR10**
